**AgRobTomato Dataset: Greenhouse Tomatoes With Different Ripeness Stages** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 449 images with 6084 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *unriped*, *breaking stage*, *reddish*, and other: *riped*.

Images in the AgRobTomato dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 14 (3% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Porto, Portugal and Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Tecnologia e CiÃªncia (INESC TEC), Portugal.
