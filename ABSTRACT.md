**AgRobTomato** Dataset images were collected on two different days (6 and 8 August 2020) at a greenhouse in Barroselas, Viana do Castelo, Portugal. To increase the representativeness of the data, the mobile robot AgRob v16, controlled by a human operator, was guided through the greenhouse inter-rows and captured RGB images of the tomato plants using a ZED camera, recording them as a video in a single ROSBag file. The video was converted into images by sampling a frame every 3 s to reduce the correlation between images, ensuring an overlapping ratio of about 60%. The images collected on the two days were merged, resulting in a dataset of 449 images with a resolution of 1280 Ã— 720 px each.

The obtained paper is framed within the activities of the [ROBOCARE ](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/robocare##intro)project which aims to research and develop intelligent precision robotic platforms for protected crops to decrease the reduction of labour burden and increase the ergonomics of the agricultural operations and the consequent increase in labour productivity and economic profitability of crops. The team leading the project is working on the development of a greenhouse tomato harvesting robot.
