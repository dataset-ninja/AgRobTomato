The **AgRobTomato Dataset: Greenhouse Tomatoes With Different Ripeness Stages** comprises images taken within a greenhouse located in Barroselas, Viana do Castelo, Portugal. The original video content taken by the mobile robot known as AgRob v16 (which was operated by a human operator) was subsequently transformed into individual images. To mitigate the correlation between these images, frames were sampled at 3-second intervals, preserving an overlapping ratio of roughly 60%. The images from the two collection days were consolidated, resulting in a dataset that encompasses a total of 449 images. Each of these images has a resolution of 1280Ã—720 pixels.

This dataset is an outcome of the [ROBOCARE](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/robocare##intro) project, which is focused on researching and developing intelligent precision robotic platforms tailored for use in protected crop environments. The project's overarching objective is to reduce the workload associated with agricultural tasks while enhancing the ergonomics of these operations. This will lead to increased labor productivity and improved economic viability for crop cultivation. Notably, the project team is actively engaged in the development of a robot specialized in harvesting tomatoes within a greenhouse setting.
